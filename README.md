#About

Serene is a guided online journal to help users evaluate and manage stress in a productive and healthy way.

Users can create journal entries. In these entries, users will evaluate their stress and assign it a level from 1 to 10. A stress scale is laid out in detail in the program. Users can then identify what is causing their stress and think about specific ways to tackle the stressors in their lives. Users are then encouraged to practice self-care and write about what they did for themselves. They are also prompted to write about something that makes him happy. This is done to remind users that even in times of stress, there are still reasons to be happy. Lastly, users reevaluate their stress levels. The goal is not for users to achieve no stress but to reduce their feelings of stress; the goal is progress, not perfection.

Users can review their past journal entries and can track their stress levels. Users can also get ideas on ways to practice self-care and can schedule time to take care of themselves.


#How to use Serene 

To use Serene, in your terminal navigate to the back end and run the following. 
-bundle install 
-rails db:migrate 
-rails s

Navigate to the front end and run the following. 

-npm i && npm start

Your computer will try to run the frontend and the backend on the same port. To remedy this, you can specify a port in your terminal. After entering npm start, your terminal should ask you if you want to run the frontend on another port. Simply entering y in response to this prompt is sufficient.
